This to-do list is structured as a **sequential roadmap**. I've broken it down into "Build Blocks" so you can finish one logical piece of the app before moving to the next.

This list follows the **"Zero-Sunk-Cost"** principle: every tool mentioned (Next.js, Supabase, Resend, Stripe) has a free tier that will cost you **$0** until you have consistent traffic.
